Next.js Hackathon Project

This project is a responsive and pixel-perfect Next.js website developed for a hackathon challenge. The design was based on a Figma file provided by our teacher, with key focus areas including:

1. Adherence to Figma Design: Pixel-perfect implementation to match the design.


2. Responsiveness: Ensured seamless display across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).


3. Reusability: Built modular components for scalability.

Purpose

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in:

Converting Figma designs into a fully functional web application.

Developing reusable, responsive, and accessible components.

Implementing Next.js features such as app routing for seamless navigation.

Future Improvements

While dynamic routing was planned (e.g., /products/[id]), time constraints prevented its implementation. Future updates may include:

Dynamic Routing: For pages like product details or blog posts.

Unit Tests: Adding tests to ensure component functionality and reliability.

Performance Optimizations: Implement lazy loading, image optimizations, and caching.
